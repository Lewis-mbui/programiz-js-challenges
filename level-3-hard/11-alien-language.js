// Write a function to determine the order of 
// characters in an alien language.

// Assume you suddenly find a list of words from an alien 
// language. If they are sorted in ascending order of their 
// language, return the order of all characters present in 
// the list. e.g: ["ba", "cb", "cd", "ad"] the order of all
// characters is "cbad"
// and from ["wrt", "wrf", "er", "ett", "rftt"] the order of
// all characters is "wertf"
const wordsList = ["wrt", "wrf", "er", "ett", "rftt"];
